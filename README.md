# joint-angle-detection-project

A Python project for detecting and analyzing joint angles from video or image data using computer vision techniques. Useful for biomechanics, sports analytics, physical therapy, and robotics.

## Features

- Detects human joint positions from images or video frames
- Calculates joint angles in real time or from pre-recorded data
- Exports joint angle data to CSV for further analysis
- Visualization tools for joint movements

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/fahad3920/joint-angle-detection-project.git
    cd joint-angle-detection-project
    ```

2. Install required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(If `requirements.txt` is not present, ensure you have OpenCV, NumPy, and any other required libraries.)*

## Usage

- To run the joint angle detection script:
    ```bash
    python joint_angle_detection.py
    ```

- The script will process video or image input, detect joints, and save angles to `joint_angles.csv`.
